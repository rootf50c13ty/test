sudo apt install git

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"

We can see all of the configuration items that have been set by typing:
//git config --list//


git init - Step 1: Create a local git repository 

git status - to track unknown files

git add <filename> - adding file to staging
 
git-commit - Record changes to the repository

git commit -m "This is my first commit!"

git checkout -b <my branch name> 

git branch - listing branches

git remote add origin https://github.com/cubeton/mynewrepository.git - adding remote repo

git push -u origin master

To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run 
//git push origin yourbranchname//
. GitHub will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository: 


In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the 
//git pull origin master//
command (when working on the master branch).

Now we can use the 
//git log //
command again to see all new commits.

(You may need to switch branches back to the master branch. 
You can do that using the 
//git checkout master //
command.)
